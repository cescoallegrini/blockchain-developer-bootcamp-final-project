# Hardhat Project


## USAGE
### ‚û°Ô∏è DEPLOY

Check `TOKEN_ADDRESS` (DAI Rinkeby) in the deploy script and then:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
By default script uses default hardhat network. To choose network run with:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è UPGRADE
Remember to add the `PROXY_ADDRESS` and then:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade.js
```

State variable can't change, upgrade script allows only to update functions or add new state variables.
(If I had time before November 30, I would use this script to add the employee salary update functionality to the Salaries smart contract).



### üîë ENV

Create an `.env` file on root

```

## üìñ NOTES

I used OpenZeppelin tooling to easily and securely deploy an upgradeable contract using the UUPS proxy pattern.
